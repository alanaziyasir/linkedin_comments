While plenty of AI courses exist, what’s missing is a true AI-focused college model—one that builds both foundational skills and sector-specific expertise. AI in healthcare looks very different from AI in finance or energy. To really close the gap, we need talent that marries AI know-how with domain expertise, delivered through hands-on, practical learning, career placement, and advancement opportunities.

How to choose between GPT-5, Claude, Gemini or now HUMAIN for YOUR specific use case. How to handle edge cases when your users aren’t typical (at Futuroos, we’re building AI-powered behavioral assessment for 5-9 year olds that predicts career aptitudes through gameplay and learn from it as well - try explaining that to traditional ML approaches). How to optimize costs without sacrificing quality when you need real-time inference. My ideal AI learning path: Start with a real problem, ship something in week 1, iterate with actual user feedback, THEN understand why it works. Theory should support building, not precede it. Would love to see Hunain Academy focus on ‘AI in production’ - dealing with rate limits, handling hallucinations, building guardrails for sensitive use cases (essential when your AI assesses children’s potential). The messy stuff that actually determines if your product succeeds. Saudi needs builders who can ship, not just prototype. This is exactly the right vision 🚀",

HUMAIN is all about enhancing public living via AI. 1# What needed to be Focused as asked? There is a strong need to prioritize AI awareness and digital dexterity. Not everyone in enterprises or corporations is digitally fluent, so training should ensure professionals can confidently adopt AI as a partner aligned with organizational goals—not as a replacement for human talent.

At 6G Academy we share the same belief: fluency in AI is becoming what English or software programming once was - essential for every professional. Two aspects I’d emphasize: -> Methodology – teaching people how to learn AI, while also letting AI itself adapt to the learner’s pace, language, and style. This personalized learning journey will be the real unlock, though tuning it to the last mile will be challenging. -> Domain context – applied AI isn’t one-size-fits-all. We’re laser-focused on connectivity and adjacent domains (mobile, #quantum, #privateAI, #swarmintelligence for distributed #physicalAI). Personally, I see physical AI (#robots, #distributeddevices, #embodiedsystems) as a low-hanging fruit to move AI out of the PC and into daily imagination and interaction. Even at home, I explore this with my kids (11, 8, and 6), it sparks curiosity and makes AI tangible. Would love to explore collaboration.

From my experience across entertainment, media, and marketplaces, working with both fresh graduates and seasoned professionals, I can offer few thoughts. - The traditional path of long academic study followed by years of hands-on work isn’t scalable for AI. It leaves many professionals unprepared for complex challenges and limits cross-industry innovation, whether in drug discovery, gaming, or personalized commerce. - Universities and online platforms already cover AI fundamentals. What’s urgently needed is applied AI education, how to use emerging models and tools in real-world contexts to drive second-order innovation. - This calls for modern curricula and teaching methods that produce immediately deployable skills, supported by local and international partnerships between industry and academia. Experts, students, and researchers should collaborate to build courses that address real use cases. - Finally, we need learning tracks tailored to different levels of AI literacy. Some theory is important, but the emphasis must be on practical, applied skills that empower more people to put AI to work.",

I also believe that a strong feedback and iteration system is essential. Learners should be encouraged to share their experiences after each course, especially around the practical value and clarity of instruction. Regularly analyzing this feedback would allow for continuous refinement of content and teaching methods. Finally, the development of a data-driven learning platform should be a top priority. Tracking outcomes like learner progress, job placements, and startup successes would provide valuable insights into what’s working and what needs adjustment.
