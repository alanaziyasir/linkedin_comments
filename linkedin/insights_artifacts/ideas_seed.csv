How to optimize costs without sacrificing quality when you need real-time inference. My ideal AI learning path: Start with a real problem, ship something in week 1, iterate with actual user feedback, THEN understand why it works. Theory should support building, not precede it.

Academc training must be progressive, balanced, and multidimensional—integrating skills, knowledge, and experience as complementary pillars. Motivation to learn is a spark; without structure, it fades. The Academy can turn that spark into a sustainable flame by meeting learners at different entry points and guiding them through well-designed stages. Global best practices, the NICE Framework, emphasize aligning skill, knowledge, and competency with industry outcomes. In this context, Hunain Academy should put learner motivation at the center—a higher priority than filtering or testing. Challenges should serve as enablers, introduced purposefully to reinforce learning or validate readiness, never at the cost of discouragement. Sustaining motivation first ensures lasting engagement, stronger performance, and real employability.

From our experience, this is what resonates most: 1. Build tracks for priority sectors in Saudi Vision 2030 (energy, finance, healthcare, logistics, construction) 2. Bridging leadership & strategy with AI adoption — AI + Leadership & Change Management - Most AI programs focus on tools; very few prepare leaders to drive adoption, manage AI ethics, and align AI with business strategy. 3. Entrepreneurship & AI for Startups - Offer a track that empowers entrepreneurs to build AI-powered businesses, pitch investors, and deploy MVPs. - This fills a gap as most AI training ignores the startup ecosystem in Saudi. Most importantly, what’s missing today is training rarely addresses AI implementation barriers: change management, culture, and workforce adoption.

I.e.not how banks implement their custom built LLMs but how the local restaurant chain or travel agency can benefit from it 2) It's what's skills are lacking in the market. For both Saudi companies but also international companies coming to the market (to make sure they first use local talent before bringing people from abroad). This will perhaps have different levels.

However, university program curricula are often disconnected from labor market needs, and adapting to rapid digital change is slow., as many faculty still see AI as a threat rather than an enabling tool. To drive meaningful change, AI training for universities must redefine their role in preparing graduates for today’s and tomorrow’s job market. Two guiding values are key: First, alignment, using curriculum mapping to link courses to any pre-defined national qualification frameworks and employer-demanded skills. Second: integration, embedding AI across all courses across programs, not just electives. This approach produces more competitive programs and curricula that remain relevant. For faculty, buy-in comes from practical, immediate value.

For instance when training financial analysts focus on retrieving data from financial filings for deeper analysis, when its lawyers then focus on laws and regulations. Main issue with tutorials is giving abstract examples like booking an airline ticket. 2. What’s missing is a lack of “video gamer” mindset. This means a tutorial must first deliver that aha moment immediately by getting users to run a program fast so they can play with it. And only then start breaking down the concepts needed to build it. I ran a course like this recently. Link below. 3. Ideal learning path for knowledge workers should start from the most fun things which in my mind is just getting a GitHub repo to run. Trouble shooting is vastly more relevant for new users than core programming. Once they know how to immediately apply what they’ve learned, then the fly wheel begins.

Beyond technical training, we need curricula that address: AI governance and data governance as the foundation of responsible adoption. AI ethics and security to ensure solutions are safe, trusted, and regulation-ready. Leadership education — empowering executives to design AI roadmaps, governance models, and automation strategies. Case studies and real-world examples drawn from multiple industries to make the learning practical and immediately relevant.
